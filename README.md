# scrabbleGame

Scrabble Game 

Game Improvement:

I added another step to the program which will take the answer from the user and double-check that the user only used the provided letters. This makes it a playable game, which actually checks that the user is not cheating. And since it checks this before the binary search, the program doesn't waste time looking for a word that does not even fit the criteria. Therefore, this enhances the gameplay by making the game user-friendly with proper checks, and by reducing the time it would otherwise spend to look for a word that it need not look for.
